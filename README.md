### Project Structure

"The frontend was initialized using Vite to streamline the integration of tools such as Tailwind CSS, Prettier, TypeScript, and more.
### Client
The frontend utilizes Redux Toolkit as its state management solution. It includes a 'taskApi' responsible for handling server requests and a 'slice' for managing modals. Within the 'Board' component, drag-and-drop functionality is implemented for cards located in different columns (To-Do, In Progress, and Done). These cards can be edited, sorted, filtered, and moved between columns.
